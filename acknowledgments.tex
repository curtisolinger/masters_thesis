I would like to thank my wife for encouraging me to undertake a master's degree and supporting me through the process. I honestly could not have done it without her. I would like to thank my advisor Dr. Joseph Gubeladze who kindly and humbly worked with me on this thesis. He always took the time to teach me and to answer the many questions I had. The generosity of his time is deeply appreciated. I would also like to thank David Erickson for his help solving some of the algorithmic challenges we faced.
